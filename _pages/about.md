Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Cornell University. My research interests are in Empirical Industrial Organization and Environmental and Energy Economics. I am currently on the job market and expect to graduate in Spring 2020.

I will be available for interviews at the 2020 ASSA Annual Meeting in San Diego.
