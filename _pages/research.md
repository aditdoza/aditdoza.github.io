[China's Industrial Policy: An Empirical Evaluation](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26075 "China's Industrial Policy: An Empirical Evaluation") 
with Panle Jia Barwick and Myrto Kalouptsidi
*NBER Working Paper No. 26075*


Industrial policies, broadly defined as policies that shape a country’s or region’s industry structure by either promoting or limiting certain industries or sectors, have been widely used in developed and developing countries. Despite their importance, few empirical studies directly evaluate the welfare consequences of these policies using micro-level data. This study examines an important industrial policy in China – the policy to develop the country’s shipbuilding industry to the largest worldwide in the 2000s. Using comprehensive data on shipyards worldwide, we quantify the magnitude of China’s industrial policies in supporting its domestic ship building industry using a dynamic model. Our estimates suggest that the combined policy support exceeded 500 billion RMB from 2006 to 2013, boosted China’s domestic investment and entry by 270% and 200%, respectively, and enhanced its world market share by 40%. On the other hand, the policy created sizable distortions and led to increased fragmentation and idleness. Production and investment subsidies can be justified based on market share considerations, but entry subsidies are wasteful. The distortions induced by industrial policy could have been significantly reduced by implementing counter-cyclical policies and by targeting subsidies towards more productive firms. Finally, we find little evidence in support of the traditional justifications for industrial policies. Our results point to the importance of non-economic considerations in contributing to the policy design.


[The Morbidity Cost of Air Pollution: Evidence from Consumer Spending in China](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24688 "The Morbidity Cost of Air Pollution: Evidence from Consumer Spending in China")
with Panle Jia Barwick, Shanjun Li and Deyu Rao
*NBER Working Paper No. 24688*

Developing and fast-growing economies have some of the worse air pollution in the world, but there is a lack of systematic evidence on the health especially morbidity impact of air pollution in these countries. Based on the universe of credit and debit card transactions in China from 2013 to 2015, this paper provides to our knowledge the first analysis of the morbidity cost of PM2.5 for the entire population of a developing country. To address potential endogeneity in pollution exposure, we construct an instrumental variable by modelling the spatial spillovers of PM2.5 due to long-range transport. We propose a flexible distributed-lag model that incorporates the IV approach to capture the dynamic response to past pollution exposure. Our analysis shows that PM2.5 has a significant impact on healthcare spending in both the short and medium terms that survives an array of robustness checks. The annual reduction in national healthcare spending from complying with the World Health Organization’s annual standard of 10 mg/m3 would amount to $42 billion, or nearly 7% of China’s total healthcare spending in 2015. In contrast to the common perception that the morbidity impact is modest relative to the mortality impact, our estimated morbidity cost of air pollution is about two-thirds of the mortality cost from the recent literature.
