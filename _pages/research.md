### [Long-term Contracts and Efficiency in the Liquefied Natural Gas Industry](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xvfh0of1r5vg8ff/NahimZahur_LNG_Contracts_Draft_2019.pdf?dl=0 "Long-term Contracts and Efficiency in the Liquefied Natural Gas Industry")

Long-term contracts facilitate efficient levels of investment by sellers faced with the risk of ex-post holdup. Contractual rigidities, however, reduce the ability of the market to respond flexibly to demand uncertainty. This paper provides the first empirical analysis of the trade-off between hold-up risk and contract rigidity, focusing on the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry, where long-term contracts account for over 70% of trade. I structurally estimate a model of contracting, investment and spot trade that incorporates hold-up risk and contractual rigidities, using a rich dataset on LNG contracts, investment, trade flows, and spot prices. LNG buyers are estimated to have substantial bargaining power, implying that sellers face considerable hold-up risk when making investment decisions. In the short-run, allocative efficiency would improve through reduced use of long-term contracts. However, investment decreases by 35% in the absence of long-run contracting, suggesting that long-term contracts play a significant role in combatting holdup at the cost of short-term allocative efficiency.

### [China's Industrial Policy: An Empirical Evaluation](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26075 "China's Industrial Policy: An Empirical Evaluation") 
with Panle Jia Barwick and Myrto Kalouptsidi, 2019.

*NBER Working Paper No. 26075*


Industrial policies, broadly defined as policies that shape a country’s or region’s industry structure by either promoting or limiting certain industries or sectors, have been widely used in developed and developing countries. Despite their importance, few empirical studies directly evaluate the welfare consequences of these policies using micro-level data. This study examines an important industrial policy in China – the policy to develop the country’s shipbuilding industry to the largest worldwide in the 2000s. Using comprehensive data on shipyards worldwide, we quantify the magnitude of China’s industrial policies in supporting its domestic ship building industry using a dynamic model. Our estimates suggest that the combined policy support exceeded 500 billion RMB from 2006 to 2013, boosted China’s domestic investment and entry by 270% and 200%, respectively, and enhanced its world market share by 40%. On the other hand, the policy created sizable distortions and led to increased fragmentation and idleness. Production and investment subsidies can be justified based on market share considerations, but entry subsidies are wasteful. The distortions induced by industrial policy could have been significantly reduced by implementing counter-cyclical policies and by targeting subsidies towards more productive firms. Finally, we find little evidence in support of the traditional justifications for industrial policies. Our results point to the importance of non-economic considerations in contributing to the policy design.


### [The Morbidity Cost of Air Pollution: Evidence from Consumer Spending in China](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24688 "The Morbidity Cost of Air Pollution: Evidence from Consumer Spending in China")
with Panle Jia Barwick, Shanjun Li and Deyu Rao, 2018. R&R at The Journal of the European Economic Association.

*NBER Working Paper No. 24688*

Developing and fast-growing economies have some of the worse air pollution in the world, but there is a lack of systematic evidence on the health especially morbidity impact of air pollution in these countries. Based on the universe of credit and debit card transactions in China from 2013 to 2015, this paper provides to our knowledge the first analysis of the morbidity cost of PM2.5 for the entire population of a developing country. To address potential endogeneity in pollution exposure, we construct an instrumental variable by modelling the spatial spillovers of PM2.5 due to long-range transport. We propose a flexible distributed-lag model that incorporates the IV approach to capture the dynamic response to past pollution exposure. Our analysis shows that PM2.5 has a significant impact on healthcare spending in both the short and medium terms that survives an array of robustness checks. The annual reduction in national healthcare spending from complying with the World Health Organization’s annual standard of 10 mg/m3 would amount to $42 billion, or nearly 7% of China’s total healthcare spending in 2015. In contrast to the common perception that the morbidity impact is modest relative to the mortality impact, our estimated morbidity cost of air pollution is about two-thirds of the mortality cost from the recent literature.


### [Market Power and Spatial Price Discrimination in the Liquefied Natural Gas Industry](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u181kafor0v1ywl/NahimZahur_LNG_MarketPower_Draft_NOV2019.pdf?dl=0 "Market Power and Spatial Price Discrimination in the Liquefied Natural Gas Industry")

The liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry is characterized by systematic inter-regional price differentials, raising the question of whether sellers price discriminate. This paper measures market power in the LNG spot market and studies how market power influences pricing, trade and welfare. I develop a method for inferring market conduct that utilizes information on sellers’ pricing and quantity decisions across multiple geographically segmented markets. My test for market conduct is based on the observation that sellers exercising market power engage in third-degree price discrimination, whereas sellers behaving competitively do not. Using data
from 2006 to 2017 on spot market trade flows, spot prices, shipping costs and seller capacities, I estimate a structural model of LNG trade and pricing that incorporates spatial differentiation, capacity constraints and trade frictions and flexibly nests different models of seller market power. I find that seller decisions are consistent with a Cournot model and unlikely to be generated by a competitive model. The total deadweight loss from market power is estimated to be USD 12 billion, or about 4.5% of total revenue. I find that market power plays a key role in exacerbating inter-regional price differentials.


## Works in Progress

### Traffic Congestion and Consumer Spending
with Deyu Rao

The cost of congestion is a key input in the design of transportation policy. Existing estimates of the social cost of traffic congestion account for the value of travel time, increased air pollution and accidents, and the impact on subjective well-being. We highlight an important additional cost: congestion disrupts economic activities. Consumers who cancel or postpone their spending plans on congested days incur a cost from not being able to engage in consumption at their preferred time. This paper investigates how traffic congestion affects consumption, focusing on Beijing in 2014. Using high-frequency credit and debit card consumption and traffic congestion data, we show that a 10% increase in travel time leads to a 2.4% decrease in consumption on the same day. We find little evidence to suggest that consumers substitute consumption over time.
